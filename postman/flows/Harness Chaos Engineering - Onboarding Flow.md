# Flow: [Harness Chaos Engineering - Onboarding Flow]

## Flow Overview

This flow is used to onboard new users to the Harness Chaos Engineering platform.

This flow tries to replicate some of the steps in the [Chaos Onboarding Flow](https://developer.harness.io/docs/chaos-engineering/quickstart#create-your-first-chaos-experiment) that a new user follows to get started with Harness Chaos Engineering through the UI.
